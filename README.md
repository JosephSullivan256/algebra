## Building

To build the project, first clone it:

```git clone https://github.com/JosephSullivan256/algebra.git```

Next, install npm packages:

```npm install```

Finally, build:

```npm run build```

Currently, webpack is set to `watch` so that the typescript is compiled again each time you save.
